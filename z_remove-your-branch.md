# Removing Your Branch

There may be various reasons to remove your branch. For example, if you are testing a branch or you miss-name the branch etc.

To remove your branch, do the following:

1. Go to the **Master Branch** (master). 

2. Click the **branches link** (see example below). This shows all the branches you own.
