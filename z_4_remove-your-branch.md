# Removing Your Branch

Like me, you may have a reason to remove your branch. For example, if you are testing a branch or miss-name the branch, or you decide it's outdated, etc. Whatever the reason, here's how you remove your branch.  

To remove your branch, do the following:

1. Go to the **Master Branch** (master). 

2. Click the **branches link** (see example below). This shows all the branches you own.

3. Click the **Red Trash Can** icon to delete.
