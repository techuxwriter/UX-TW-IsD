# What is a Git Branch? 

Without being too technical, the default branch name in Git repository is the Git Master Branch and is controlled by the Git Admin.  

## Editing in Git

As a contributor (you), this is the branch from which you (for the most part) create your Git branches. Think of your branch as a staging area, your sandbox, where you can make direct edits/changes to the content before you share with the world.

# Creating a Git Branch

To create your own branch, do the following (see example image below). **Please follow these protocols**.  

1. From the **master branch pull down menu button & field, enter:**

* Your Name (can be your real name, first and/or last, or an alias)
* Name of Your Branch 
* Month and Year
* Use Underscores ( _ )  as separators 

2. As you enter the name of your new branch, the menu will show the name of the branch and the option to _Create Branch_.

3. Click **Create branch**:
