# UX Writer, Technical Writer, and Instructional Designer GitHub Site

If you're familiar with Git/GitHub then head to the [Wiki portion of this GitHub site](https://github.com/techuxwriter/UX-Tech-Writer-IsD-GitHub/wiki) where you can enjoy the topics and make suggested changes to the site.   

If you are unfamiliar with Git/GitHub, this is your starting point. While Git can be a bit scary for non-technical users (folks who do not use command line, such as UNIX), the GitHub interface is quite easy to use and I invite you to participate and submit your suggestions for improvment, addtions, and join in. :slightly_smiling_face
