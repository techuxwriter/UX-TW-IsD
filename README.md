If you are unfamiliar with Git/GitHub, this is your starting point. While Git can be a bit scary for non-technical users (folks who do not use command line, such as UNIX), the GitHub interface is quite easy to use and I invite you to participate and submit your suggestions for improvement, additions, and join in.
