# Git Basic Terms/Concepts

These are some of the basic concepts and terms that I have learned while using Git. It is not exhaustive, but rather a starting point. In addtion, this GitHub focuses on the GitHub interface functionality not Git command line fuctionality. 

This section discusses the following main topics:

* [GitHub](#github)
* [Git](#git)
* [Open Source Project](#open-source-project)
* [Git Master Branch](#git-master-branch)
* [Git Commits](#git-commits)
* [Git Pull Request](#git-pull-request)
* [Markdown Files](#markdown-files)
* [Useful Git Links](#useful-git-links)

## GitHub

Essentially, there are two main versions of GitHub the UNIX/Command Line version and the online interface version. Though a GitHub can be thought of as a repository for hosting content, Git itself is a command-line tool that power users (such as engineering) use. While I have explored using the CLI and [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm), etc., personally, I prefer the interface, which is more user-friendly. See [Git Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) for more details. 

* **Note:** There are many resources for advance Git CLI usage, and lots of UNIX/Linux commands for Git. I'm not going to cover those but would encourage you to learn these.  

## Git

Git generally refers to the editing for a file stored in GitHub. See [Git Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) for more details. 

## Open Source Project

Git is an [Open Source Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source). Basically, they are community-based; it means that anybody can readily see the code you create on the Web and can edit, add, delete, comment, etc. 

## Git Master Branch

Branching is a core concept in GitHub. When you branch, you copy all the files residing in that particular branch. I own the Master Branch and therefore monitor requested changes to this Git site.  

You can create your own branches from these Master Branches. Because of this, it's extremely important that when you create a new branch, it is created from the Master Branch when working on the .md content. 

## Git Commits 

Without going too deep, basically, your commit/ a commit is part of the editing process. You edit the .md file then perform a commit. This is the way you save your suggested changes from the branch you created from the Master Branch.

On the GitHub interface, when you commit the changes, it simply means _save your changes_. The Commit button (bottom of the .md file/page) is used to save your changes to your local branch, not the Master Branch.  You do this before peforming a Pull Request (PR). Until you submit a PR, no one can see your changes (your commits).  

Whenever you add, edit, or delete a file, you're making a commit and adding them to your branch. The process of commits keeps track in GitHub of your progress as you work on your own branch.

* **Note:** Commits also create a history of your work that everyone can follow so that everyone can understand what you've done and why. Each commit should contain an associated commit message, a description explaining why a particular change/s you requested were made.

## Git Pull Request 

A Pull Request (or PR) initiates a review and/or discussion about your commits: the additions/changes you want to implement. In GitHub, anyone can see what changes you have made that might be merged (merged into the Master Branch) if your request is accepted.

## Markdown Files

[Markdown Files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) (or .md) are the raw files that you edit.  Markdown syntax controls the display of the document from formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, creating lists, etc. 

## Useful Git Links

There's a lot of info out there. Here's a few to get you started.
