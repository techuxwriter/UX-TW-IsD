# Getting Notifications

Let's say that you want to receive notifications about changes and updates to the master branch made by other collaborators, then change the notification to Watch, as described below.

1. From the **Master Branch** (master), go to the Watch dialog box, top of the page (see image below).

2. Select **Watching** from the pull-down menu button. You will now receive notifications (see image below).
